# Voting App
This "basejump" is a fullstack project that I'm working on to attain the Back End Certificate at http://freecodecamp.com.

## User Stories

1. As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them. **(completed)**
2. As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends. **(completed)**
3. As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls. **(in progress)**
4. As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore. **(in progress)**
5. As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items. **(completed)**
6. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls. **(in progress)**
7. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.) **(in progress)**
8. As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option. **(in progress)**
